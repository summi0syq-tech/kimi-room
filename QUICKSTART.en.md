No coding needed. 0 servers, 0 domains, 0 monthly fees.

## One-click deploy (recommended)

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/marikagura/kimi-room)

Click the button above → Vercel does the rest automatically:

1. Asks you to sign in with GitHub (no account? make one · free)
2. Forks this repo to your GitHub automatically
3. Builds + deploys automatically · gives you an `xxx.vercel.app` URL in ~3 minutes
4. Open the URL and it works

All your data (chat · memory · calendar · finance) lives in **your own browser**.
The author can't see it. Vercel can't either (it only hosts the static site).

Want it on your iPhone home screen? Open `xxx.vercel.app` in Safari → Share → Add
to Home Screen → full-screen PWA.

## Alternative: one-click Netlify

If Vercel's phone-number verification blocks you / you'd rather not give a phone
number → use Netlify instead, same code, GitHub OAuth usually goes straight
through.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/marikagura/kimi-room)

Click the button → sign in with GitHub → it forks + builds automatically · in a
few minutes you get an `xxx.netlify.app` URL.

Installing the PWA to your home screen · where data is stored · everything is the
same as the Vercel section.

## Configure the LLM (optional)

After opening the site, click `settings` at the bottom-right and fill:

- **API endpoint** · e.g. `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
- **API key** · your own (stored only in your browser, never uploaded)
- **Model name** · e.g. `gpt-4o-mini` / `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` / `deepseek-chat`

It works without a key too · just the Heartbeat ✨ LLM button produces nothing
when pressed.

OpenAI format is enough (most providers support it). In mainland China you can use
DeepSeek / Zhipu / Qwen.

## Make it your own (AI-assisted · no coding needed)

1. Copy the GitHub repo link: `https://github.com/marikagura/kimi-room`
2. Paste it to ChatGPT or Claude and say: "help me change xxx" · e.g.:
   - "change every '他' to '(his name)'"
   - "change the home accent color to blue"
   - "add a todo-list module"
3. The LLM gives you changed code → commit to your forked repo → Vercel
   auto-redeploys

## Run it on your own computer (dev only)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marikagura/kimi-room.git
cd kimi-room
npm install
npm run dev
# http://localhost:3000
```

## Can I just use the author's URL?

No. There is no public hosted URL. This repo = a recipe for you to run yourself,
not a storefront.

The data is entirely your own. After a one-click deploy = your private PWA.
