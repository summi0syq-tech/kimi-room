a room for one person and her other one.

An open-source companion PWA. Six rooms — assemble them yourself: each is an
addon (a building block); pick which six sit on the home grid in
`/backstage/settings`, the rest fall to the bottom (see [ADDONS.en.md](ADDONS.en.md)).
**Atlas** ships built-in. Your data lives in your browser. No server, no domain,
no data collection. Code AGPL v3, artwork CC BY-NC.

> **Just want to use it?** → [QUICKSTART.en.md](QUICKSTART.en.md) · 5 minutes · one-click deploy
> **Want to change it?** Hand this whole README to your AI — it'll help.

## Two paths

### Path A: I just have an API key

Take [QUICKSTART](QUICKSTART.en.md):
1. One-click Vercel deploy
2. Fill your LLM endpoint + key in /settings
3. DONE. Data lives in your browser's IndexedDB; switching machines loses it.

### Path B: I have a VPS and want a full system

You want more than a shell. You want server-side persistence, an autonomous
loop, Telegram, ops.

kimi-room is the **frontend shell**. Its data layer is pluggable:

```
src/lib/stores/types.ts        ← the 9 store interfaces
src/lib/stores/idb-adapter.ts  ← default IndexedDB (browser-local)
src/lib/stores/index.ts        ← where you swap the adapter
```

Swap in your own backend: implement the `AdapterBundle` interface, point it at
your Supabase / Postgres / Obsidian / Notion / whatever DB. The interface is
fully defined in `types.ts`.

The author has open-sourced that **memory engine** as
**[kimi-core](https://github.com/marikagura/kimi-core)**. Once it is running, set
`NEXT_PUBLIC_KIMI_BACKEND=core` + `KIMI_CORE_URL` + `KIMI_API_KEY`, and the room
redirects to it as its memory engine; chat generation continues to use your own
official subscription / API. The two compose. The distinction between RAG and
redirect is documented in **[docs/BACKENDS.en.md](docs/BACKENDS.en.md)**.

Beyond this, a full deployment typically also builds:
- **An autonomous loop** (dream / intel / scheduler — let the system wake on its
  own, process mail on its own, write its own diary)
- **A domain** (Vercel gives you .vercel.app; set a custom domain in the dashboard)

## Every module is changeable

This is a shell. Every room can wire to your own backend, change its logic, or be
deleted. Hand this section, plus what you want changed, to your AI:

| module | default | can become |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **Heartbeat** (score/sky) | local scoring, manual | your VPS auto-scoring, cloud sync. Scoring logic entirely yours |
| **Keepsakes** | IndexedDB photos + text | cloud sync (Supabase / S3 / anything) |
| **Study** | local bookshelf + "read-together" LLM feature | cloud sync. Drop "read-together" if you don't want it |
| **Calendar** | manual input + local storage | any calendar API (not just Google). Wellbeing data can be auto-collected from app usage |
| **Memory** | local IndexedDB | your DB. Review flow editable or removable |
| **Disc** | local chat screenshots + playlist | archive to cloud |
| **Backstage** | fixed /ops page | add any ops panel you want |
| **All manual inputs** | hand-filled | all replaceable with automation. Candles via app_open, sleep via sensors, finance via bank API |
| **Character / RP features** | character config in /settings | deletable wholesale. Tell your AI "remove all character and RP features" |

**Once you wire a VPS, the API-key config in /settings isn't needed** — LLM calls
go through your gateway, not the browser.

## Context for the AI

If you hand this repo to ChatGPT / Claude / any AI to change it, tell it:

- This is a Next.js App Router + TypeScript project
- The data layer is in `src/lib/stores/` — all CRUD goes through the `StoreContract<T>` interface
- LLM calls are in `src/lib/llm-client.ts` — OpenAI chat-completion format
- The system prompt is in `src/lib/system-prompt.ts` — `{{user}}` `{{char}}` template vars
- The visual theme is in `src/app/globals.css` @theme — Mucha dark-gilt art style
- Persona is edited on the /settings page (name, avatar, prompt)
- Every module lives independently under `src/app/room/`

Common changes:
- "Change him to her" → pronoun in `system-prompt.ts` + the name in /settings
- "Change colors" → `globals.css` @theme values
- "Add a module" → `src/app/room/<new>/page.tsx` + a new `src/components/` component · how an addon reaches the home grid: [ADDONS.en.md](ADDONS.en.md)
- "Wire my backend" → write a new adapter implementing `AdapterBundle`
- "Remove RP features" → delete the character bits in /settings + the persona template in system-prompt.ts

## Six rooms

| # | room | content |

| I | Heartbeat | memory star-chart + emotion score |
| II | Keepsakes | one-line keepsakes + photos |

| IV | Calendar | calendar + finance + sleep |
| V | Memory | memory review |
| VI | Disc | past conversations + playlist |

- MJ originals live elsewhere (iCloud / Dropbox); commit the compressed web-size copy only.
- Commit in batches: `add: mood images batch 1 (vienna + ocean)`.

## Design system

Colors (see `src/app/globals.css` `@theme`):

## Deploy

```bash
vercel login
vercel           # .vercel.app preview URL
```

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_KIMI_GATEWAY` env var to your own MCP/backend URL if wiring beyond client-side IDB + LLM proxy. Custom domain optional — point any owned domain at the Vercel project.
