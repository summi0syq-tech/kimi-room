# Backends

kimi-room is presentation-oriented: a self-contained interface layer. It does not
provide a memory backend, and is not intended to serve as one. It supports two
deployment modes, which are deliberately distinct.

---

## 1. Local (default)

The default mode. It requires no configuration.

- **Storage.** In-browser IndexedDB. Calendar, keepsakes, study, sleep, and the
  memory worldbook are all held on the device; no data is transmitted.
- **Chat.** Bring-your-own-credentials. The endpoint and key are configured in
  Settings (an official subscription, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint). The
  chat operates as a transcript with retrieval restricted to the local worldbook.

This mode is intentionally minimal; the interface is not intended to function as
a system of record. A deployment that already maintains a structured memory store
should supply its own persistence layer (see mode 2).

---

## 2. Core — redirecting memory to a running kimi-core

A deployment that operates a structured memory engine can use kimi-room as a
frontend over it — the same architecture as the reference (canon) deployment: a
web frontend over a memory gateway. That engine is available as open source:

> https://github.com/marikagura/kimi-core

In this mode the two concerns separate cleanly and remain composable:

- **Memory** is provided by kimi-core (retrieval and persistence).
- **Generation** continues to use the operator's own subscription or API — the
  same bring-your-own-credentials chat as the local mode.

Integrating kimi-core therefore does not delegate generation to it. The model is
supplied by the operator; kimi-core supplies retrieval. The two are independent.

### Mechanism

```
browser  ──{ name, arguments }──▶  /api/core  ──MCP──▶  kimi-core gateway
(no key)                          (holds key)           (memory_search, …)
```

- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_KIMI_BACKEND=core`.
- Set `KIMI_CORE_URL` and `KIMI_API_KEY` (server-side only; the browser does not
  receive the key — the `/api/core` route forwards calls with the Bearer token).
- `src/lib/kimi-core-client.ts` exposes `fetchCoreMemoryContext(query)` (retrieval)
  and `persistCoreMemory(key, content)`. These are intended to be invoked within a
  chat turn to inject retrieved memory into the prompt prior to calling the
  operator's model.

### Retrieval, not a CRUD substitution

kimi-core exposes an agent-text interface: `memory_search` and `reentry` return
human-readable text intended for insertion into a model prompt, not structured
records. kimi-room therefore uses kimi-core for retrieval-augmented chat (text
in, text into the prompt), and not as a structured store behind the dashboards.
The structured dashboards (calendar, sleep, keepsakes, and so on) remain on local
IndexedDB in both modes. Server-side persistence of that structured data is the
deploying operator's responsibility; kimi-room does not provide it.

## Summary

|                   | local (default)          | core                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| dashboards        | IndexedDB (on device)    | IndexedDB (on device)                 |
| chat memory       | local worldbook          | kimi-core (`memory_search`)           |
| chat model        | operator subscription / API | operator subscription / API (same) |
| configuration     | none                     | `NEXT_PUBLIC_KIMI_BACKEND=core` + `KIMI_CORE_URL` + `KIMI_API_KEY` |
| requires a backend | no                      | yes — a running kimi-core             |

kimi-room is the interface layer. The memory engine, where one is required, is
[kimi-core](https://github.com/marikagura/kimi-core).
